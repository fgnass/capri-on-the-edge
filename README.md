# Capri on the Edge

A demo Capri site running on [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions).

It uses Capri's new build target option set to [@capri-js/vercel](https://github.com/capri-js/capri/tree/main/packages/vercel).

## Credits

The design is taken from https://github.com/vercel-labs/react-on-the-edge, which in turn is based on the https://sveltekit-on-the-edge.vercel.app demo.
